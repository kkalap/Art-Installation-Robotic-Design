# Art-Installation-Robotic-Design
The technical renderings of the robotic project from my summer 2023 internship.
- Led the development virtually of a cost-effective, efficient solution to be scaled by 400x for 'The Light' art installation in Argentina, ensuring seamless integration of hardware, Raspberry Pi and Arduino, with the artistic vision, using Fusion 360, prototype modeling and python programming. 
- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills working with a 3-person team virtually to optimize project efficiency.
- Final art installation: https://vimeo.com/57244184
